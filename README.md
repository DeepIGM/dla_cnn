This code utilizes convolutional neural network models
to classify, locate, and measure Dampened Lyman Alpha emission lines
in SDSS and BOSS sightlines found in the DR7 and DR12 surveys.

Full data products are available here:

This repository also contains the absorption measurements
in simple JSON files.

Current use of the code is demonstrated in
the Jupyter notebooks (python 2.7). Pre-trained models are provided in the source here under /models.

The current state of this code is a fully working beta v0.1.

Development is underway for the DESI experiment.
